Hi this is Abishek Muthian, Today&nbsp;
I'm going to talk about Bone Health.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.140
When I was 32 years of age I&nbsp;
was told that my bones were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:15.720
like that of an 80 year old due to a&nbsp;
health disorder called Osteoporosis.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.760
Osteoporosis can make our bones&nbsp;
fragile and likely to break.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.620
1 in 3 women over the age&nbsp;
of 50 years and 1 in 5 men&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.360
will experience osteoporotic&nbsp;
fractures in their lifetime.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:37.860
It is likely that your parents and grand&nbsp;
parents are already suffering from osteoporosis.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:47.040
Osteoporosis is identified using a Bone Mineral&nbsp;
Density(BMD) scan which gives scores for our bone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.920
density and is compared with the known scores&nbsp;
from the healthy individuals of same age.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.800
I was told that these known&nbsp;
scores does not include all races,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.200
ethinicities and are generally unreliable&nbsp;
for those with pre-existing diseases.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:12.180
This makes it difficult for providing&nbsp;
healthcare, Even more so for outliers like me.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.320
I'm attempting to change that&nbsp;
with Bone Health Tracker.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:25.140
All we need to do is upload the assessment section&nbsp;
from our BMD report. It generally looks like this.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:43.080
Once we upload, The report is classified using&nbsp;
Machine Learning. Bone Health Tracker displays&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:49.680
the report, A skeleton visualization marking&nbsp;
organs from the assessment with different&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:57.360
colors to show the findings and A chart&nbsp;
to show the progress of our treatment.
 &nbsp;

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.420
I will add few more reports to&nbsp;
show the usefulness of the chart.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:11.400
The health care provider would have to compare&nbsp;
previous BMD reports every year to see if the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:18.420
treatment is working, This will save lot of time&nbsp;
for them and give better understanding to us.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:25.800
We can choose to submit our report data&nbsp;
without any personal information for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.040
researchers to analyze the Bone Mineral Density&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.260
data from different ethnicities&nbsp;
to develop better healthcare.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:43.680
With 1 in 6 people in the world expected to be&nbsp;
above age 65 by 2050, We need more investment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:51.360
in understanding the bone health and coming up&nbsp;
with better treatments for bone health diseases.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.560
Thank you for watching.
